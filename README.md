# HandGesture-based_Mouse_Control

This project highlights the integration of hand gesture recognition with interactive computing.

The system tracks the tip of the index finger to move the mouse pointer on the screen. A “click” action is triggered when the thumb touches the tip of the index finger, simulating a mouse click.
